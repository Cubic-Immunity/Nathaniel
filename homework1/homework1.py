1. How many different data types did you find?
    We found 9 different data types.
2. List all the data types you found.
    Int, float, complex, str, list, dict, tuple, bool, and NoneType
3. What variables have the same data types?
    B/m are floats, d/l are strings, and e/h/k are lists.
4. What was the data type of l? Why is it not an integer? What does str() do?
    The data type of l was a strings, it was not an integer becausethe str() method that 14 was 
    placed within converts its data type to a string.
5. Look up one more data type not given above. Repeat the same procedure.
    x = range(6)
    print(x)
    print(type(X)) # range, immutable sequence of intgers

1. What pattern do you notice about expressions returning True or False?
    If they are empty then they are false, and true if they have are conytaining something.
    They are true so long as they are non-zero and fasle otherwise.
2. Which expression surprised you about its result?
    The empty ones since I had forgotten that empty lists, dictionaries, etc. are considered false 
    in regards to their truth value.
3. Create an expression, not given above, that will return True. Why is it True?
    print(bool())
4. Create an expression, not given above, that will return False. Why is it False?
    print(1e4 == None) # This is False because 10,000 doesn't equal None, it has a real value

# --- Operators ---
 # --- Arithemetic Operators ---
print(10 + 5) # 15, + performs addition
print(10 - 5) # 5, - performs subtraction
print(2 * 4) # 8, * performs multiplcation
print(6 / 3) # 2, / performs division
print(5 % 2) # 1, % returns the remainder of the division
print(3 ** 2) # 9, ** peforms exponentiation
print(15 // 2) # 7, // performs floor division (integer division) wherein only the integer part of the division is returned

 # --- Comparison Operators ---
print(5 == 2) # False, 5 does not equal 2
print(10 != 10) # False, 10 does equal 10
print(2 < 5) # True, 2 is less than 5

"""
1. What does the operator and do? Write an expression that results in True. Write an expression that results in False.
    The operator and checks the truth value of whatever is on either side of it and returns True only
    when what is on both sides of it are also True.
2. What does the operator or do? Write an expression that results in True. Write an expression that results in False.
    The or operator checks the truth value of whatever is on either side of it and returns True so long as
    at least one of the things on either side of it is True.
3. What does the operator not do? Write an expression that results in True. Write an expression that results in False.
    The not operator switches the truth value of whatever it is being applied to, so True becomes False
    and False becomes True.
"""

"""
1. What is the difference between / and //?
    The difference is that / gives you regular division (a float), while // gives you floor divion
    wherein only the integer part of the division is returned.
2. What is the difference between % and //?
    The difference is that % gives you the remainder of the division, while // gives you the whole integer
    part of the division.
3. What operator would you use to calculate the remainder when dividing two numbers? Give an example.
    You would use the % operator to get the remainder when dividing two numbers. Example: 9 % 3 = 0
4. How do assignment operators work?
    Assignment operators work by assinging values to a variable, like the equal sign =. There are
    also shorthanded assignment operators like in the examples above +=, -=, *=, whereby you use the 
    variable itself in calculating its new value.

"""
1. Define the term slicing. For which of the manipulations did you slice your string?
    Slicing is a method by which we can extract specific portions of seqeunces. We sliced the string anytime
    we called my_string[] with whatever was inside the brackets [].
2. Call the following, describe the result:
    name = "Oski"
    print("Hello, my name is", name)

    This prints out the following: Hello, my name is Oski.
3. Call the following, describe the result.
    name = "Oski"
    print(f"Hello, my name is {name}")

    This prints out the following: Hello, my name is Oski.
4. What is the difference between the two last print statements? Hint: Look up f-strings.
    The difference is that the first one concatenates the variable name to the end of the string being 
    printed out, while the second uses f-strings to embed the variable into the string allowing for more
    versatilitiy in its usage.

2. What is the difference between ls and ls -a?
    The difference is that ls will list out the visible contents of a directory, while ls -a will print
    out all the contents of a directory including the hidden things.
3. What is a hidden file?
    A file that is not visible to the user by default (folders can also be hidden).
4. Look up 3 other flags (e.g., -a was a flag for the ls command). Define and explain how to use them on the command line.
    There is also:
    # <command> --help
    # will print out the available flags for that command, essentially the documentation

    # <command> -l
    # makes the printout be in long listing form, essentially containing extra info about the contents

    # <command> -h
    # Can combine -l (long listing) with -h (human-readable) to show file sizes kb/mb/gb.
    # Note: On Git Bash for Windows, -h may still show sizes in bytes due to implementation differences.
