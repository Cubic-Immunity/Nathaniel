# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
	# Git is a version control system that you can run locally on your 
	# own  computer
# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
	# The terminal is the program that lets you interact with the shell 
	# you are working within. The command line is the text-based
	# interface inside the terminal where you type your commands.
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
	# Windows Powershell is the type of shell that Windows uses by
	# default. Git Bash is a different kind of shell that is more
	# unix-like and works better with Git commands.
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
	# Anaconda is a distribution that bundles many different programs and
	# libraries together in one place. Conda is package and environment
	# manager that handles the changes to these packages or environments.
	# Python is the programming language itself that is bundled within
	# Anaconda.
# 5) What is VS Code? 
	# VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a scipting program, that is highly 
	# customizable, that you can use to help debug your code.
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
	# Juypter Notebook is an environment that you can use to write up 
	# and test your code. Juypter Lab is similar but it has more features
	# like allowing you to access a terminal, multiple tabs, etc.
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
	# ~/ is a shorthand for your home (or root) directory.
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
	# An absolute path is the full path to your current working directory
	# starting from your root or home directory. A relative path is one 
	# that does not start from your root directory but still tells you
	# what your current working directory is.
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
	# An absolute path would be: C:\Users\username\python_decal_fa25\course_assignments\homework2 
	# (I used \ rather than / becasue that is what is used for windows)
	# A relative path would be: course_assignments\homework2
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
	# cd ..
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
	# This essentially says to remove (rm) everything inside 
	# your current working directory (./)
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add: This command adds whatever you specify to the staging area.
# git commit: This command commits those things in the staging area to be sent to the remote repo.
# git push: This command pushes the commits to the remote repo, essentialluy saving them there.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
	# git add . is what you use to add all files in the directory 
	# to the staging area, whereas git add <file> only adds the
	# file you specify to the staging area.
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
	# git status pulls up the status of your local repo that details
	# what you have added, what files are untracked, and more. 
	# git log -1 pulls up your log of recent (specifically the most
	# recent one you used) git commits.
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
	# Cloning a repository is when you save a copy of its contents to
	# your local system, whereas pulling a repository is when you 
	# update your local copy of the repository.
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
	# I had an issue where the incorrect folder was being pushed to the remote repo, and I got it fixed
	# by asking on ed discussion about what I was doing wrong.
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
	# How can I make a folder/file no longer be tracked by git. Something I am confused about is the 
	# exact process by which git tracks which files are to be pushed the the remote repo or if files
	# are being cached.
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
	# In Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Luigi's down taunt can spike (launch downward) the enemy.
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
	# print(2 * 2) # multiples 2 by 2, it is my favorite because multiplication is exteremely useful
