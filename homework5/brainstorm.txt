1). 5 Topics
    a). Simulating a Neutron Star Accreting from a Companion Star
    b). Mapping Galactic Dust Using RR Lyrae Stars
    c). Creating Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagrams to Determine Cluster Age
    d). Modeling a Planetary Transit Light Curve
    e). Visualizing Gravitational Lensing of a Background Galaxy

2). Tools/Resoruces for the topics (ordered as above)
    a). NASA's HEASARC and Chandra data archives for reference imagery and physical parameters,
	and Astropy.
    b). Gaia DR3 catalog for RR Lyrae positions and photometry
    c). Gaia DR3 catalog for photometry and MIST/PARSEC isochrones for model comparison
    d). Lightkurve Python library and Astroquery for TESS data
    e). lenstronomy Python package for lens modeling

3). Using python skills for a single project
    a). I would like to consider the first one involving simulating a neutron star
	accreting from a companion star. I could use:
	    - Loops/conditionals: iterate through time steps of the accretion simulation,
          applying conditional triggers when critical mass is reached.
        - Functions: modularize calculations for organizationsal/reusability reasons.
        - Lists/dictionaries: store simulation data at each frame for later plotting.
        - Version Control (git): track incremental improvements in the data analysis code.

4). Dream vs Simpler Project Ideas
    a). Dream: a full animation of a binary system with a simulated particle accretion flow,
	    luminosity curve, and explosion sequence synchronized to physics-based data.
	    Simpler: a Python script that numerically models mass transfer over time and plots
	    luminosity vs. time to show when an X-ray burst would occur.
